      <p>We are proud to offer the following procedures in the calm, peaceful and convenient setting of our office:</p>
      <h3>Colposcopy</h3>
      <p>Colposcopy is an office procedure used in the evaluation of an abnormal pap smear or cervical lesion. A speculum is placed in the vagina, and the physician uses a special microscope to examine the cervix and upper vagina. Tissue biopsy samples may be obtained at this time to guide further management.</p>
      <h3>LEEP (Loop Electrocautery Excision Procedure)</h3>
      <p>This procedure used in certain situations to treat abnormal cells (dysplasia) of the cervix. The cervix is numbed with an injection. A thin layer of cervix containing the area of abnormality is then removed using an electric current directed through a thin wire loop. Most women experience mild cramping. </p>
      <h3>Endometrial Biopsy</h3>
      <p>Endometrial biopsy is a procedure used to obtain cells that line the cavity of the uterus (the endometrium). This test may be recommended in the evaluation of abnormal bleeding. A thin tube is inserted through the cervix into the uterus during a pelvic exam. A small amount of tissue is removed and sent to the pathologist for analysis. Some women experience mild cramping during the procedure. </p>
      <h3>Hysteroscopy</h3>
      <p>Hysteroscopy is when a small telescope is inserted through the dilated cervix to allow the interior of the uterus to be directly visualized. This procedure is often recommended to determine the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding such as polyps, fibroids and other intrauterine masses. While many physicians perform this procedure in the operating room on an outpatient setting, Dr. Hanna and Dr. Cushing perform hysteroscopy in the comfort of our office, avoiding the inconvenience of the operating room and its associated costs.</p>
      <h3>Ultrasound-3D/4D</h3>
      <p>Ultrasound is an imaging technique performed in our office to examine the uterus, ovaries and surrounding tissues. A thin ultrasound probe is placed in the vagina and rotated in order to examine the pelvic structures. Our team of female ultrasound technicians has over 30 years of combined gynecologic imaging experience.</p>
      <h3>Endometrial Ablation</h3>
      <p><a href="novasure.html">NovaSure</a> Endometrial Ablation is a quick, outpatient procedure that gently removes the endometrial lining of the uterus (called the ‘endometrium’) to control bleeding. Dr. Hanna and Dr. Cushing perform NovaSure Endometrial Ablation in their office under oral or IV sedation.</p>
      <h3>Urodynamic Testing</h3>
      <p>Urodynamics is helpful in determining the right treatment for problems such as incontinence or leaking urine, frequent urination, or the feeling of not emptying your bladder completely. Most patients consider urodynamic testing painless. The entire test takes approximately 20-30 minutes.</p>
      <h3>Skin Biopsy</h3>
      <p>A Skin biopsy is performed in the office to sample a tiny piece of tissue from the outside of the vagina. This procedure is recommended to determine the cause of a growth, rash or discoloration. The tissue sample is then sent to the pathologist who looks at the tissue under the microscope and reports a diagnosis. This procedure is also performed if you desire removal of a mole or wart that is bothersome or has not responded to other treatment. </p>
